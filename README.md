# Riddler

A World of Warcraft trivia addon, created as a spiritual successor to the beloved TriviaBot.

## About

For several years, the WoW community has missed TriviaBot - a popular trivia addon that brought players together through fun quiz competitions in-game. Despite many requests from fans over the years, no successor emerged to fill this void.

Until now.

Riddler aims to bring back the joy of in-game trivia to World of Warcraft, carrying forward TriviaBot's legacy while adding modern features and improvements.
